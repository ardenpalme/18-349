Any additional comments you want to make can go here.  Did you like the
project?  Was it too hard, too easy? Well, you get the idea.

A bit difficult with the dependencies installing raspberry PIs.
Project was fairly easy but probing K_p, K_d values was a boring robotic task. 
Maybe have future classes use reinforcement learning/other ML framework for this in the future?

Include a breakdown of the work split between you and your partner.

Arden Diakhite Palme - SPI, encoder

As a last little note, please make sure that all the documentation you
turn in is true and accurate.  Otherwise, we will deduct points.
